<h4>lesson 1 Internet Research</h4>
</b>
<p> Internet research refers to the process of gathering, analyzing, and interpreting information available on the internet to obtain insights, answer questions, solve problems, or make informed decisions. It involves utilizing various online resources such as search engines, databases, websites, social media platforms, and online forums to collect data and information relevant to a specific topic, industry, market, or research objective.

<h4>How can internet research help a business?</h4>
Various kinds of surveys that can be conducted online are typically referred to as “internet research” or “web surveys.” Internet research refers to the distribution of questionnaires and collection of responses via email or dedicated systems.


<h4>How important is internet research?</h4>
</b>

The Internet is a useful tool for research because it gives access to a wide range of material, makes it easier for researchers to communicate and work together, and makes it possible to employ online research tools.</p>
<b>
<h4>Why is Internet research reliable?</h4>
</b>
	The most common source of reliable, credible information you will find on the Internet is through scholarly journals and databases. These academic, peer reviewed collections provide you with extensive reports, case studies, articles and research studies to help bolster your research process. 

<h4>What are the benefits of the internet?</h4>
Internet connection is very useful for different personal tasks like sending emails, making online payments, watching movies, and playing music, making video calls. The Internet plays a very important role in shops and retail markets, as it helps to sell and make online orders. 

<h4>HISTORICAL ANTECEDENT IN THE PHILIPPINES</h4>

History of the Philippines, a survey of notable events and people in the history of the Philippines. The Philippines takes its name from Philip II, who was king of Spain during the Spanish colonization of the islands in the 16th century. Because it was under Spanish rule for 333 years and under U.S. tutelage for a further 48 years, the Philippines has many cultural affinities with the West. The country was wracked by political turmoil in the last quarter of the 20th century. 

<h4>Pre-Spanish history of the Philippines<h4>
According to what can be inferred from somewhat later accounts, the Filipinos of the 15th century must have engaged primarily in shifting cultivation, hunting, and fishing. Sedentary cultivation was the exception. Only in the mountains of northern Luzon, where elaborate rice terraces were built some 2,000 years ago, were livelihood and social organization linked to a fixed territory.
<h4>Spanish colonial period</h4>
		Spanish colonial motives were not, however, strictly commercial. The Spanish at first viewed the Philippines as a stepping-stone to the riches of the East Indies (Spice Islands), but, even after the Portuguese and Dutch had foreclosed that possibility, the Spanish still maintained their presence in the archipelago.
<h4>The 19th Century in the Philippines</h4>
		By the late 18th century, political and economic changes in Europe were finally beginning to affect Spain and, thus, the Philippines. Important as a stimulus to trade was the gradual elimination of the monopoly enjoyed by the galleon to Acapulco. The last galleon arrived in Manila in 1815, and by the mid-1830s Manila was open to foreign merchants almost without restriction. The demand for Philippine sugar and abaca (hemp) grew apace, and the volume of exports to Europe expanded even further after the completion of the Suez Canal in 1869.

<h4>The Philippine Revolutions</h4>
	In August 1896, Spanish friars uncovered evidence of the Katipunan’s plans, and its leaders were forced into premature action. Revolts broke out in several provinces around Manila. After months of fighting, severe Spanish retaliation forced the revolutionary armies to retreat to the hills. In December 1897 a truce was concluded with the Spanish. Emilio Aguinaldo, a municipal mayor and commander of the rebel forces, was paid a large sum and was allowed to go to Hong Kong with other leaders; the Spanish promised reforms as well. But reforms were slow in coming, and small bands of rebels, distrustful of Spanish promises, kept their arms; clashes grew more frequent.

<h4>Identifying Browsers </h4>
An internet browser, also known as a web browser or simply a browser, is a software program that lets you view web pages on your computer

<h4>The First Web Browser </h4>
The first web browser was called World Wide Web; later, it changed its name to Nexus. Created by Sir Tim Berners-Lee, it gave people a basic way to view web pages. However, it was a long way from the immersive online experience we have today. 
 
<h4>Modern Internet Browsers </h4>
Internet browsers have developed into powerful tools that let you safely and quickly access your favorite websites. 
 
<center><h2>Basics Browser Tools </h2></center>
<h4/>Hyperlinks</h4>
 - A hyperlink is an element in an HTML document that links to eithe,r another portion of the document or to another document altogether. On webpages, hyperlinks are usually colored purple or blue and are sometimes underlined. 
<h4>Bonus Tools</h4> 
– it’s a tools extra tools or extra setting of a browsers Example: Browsers VPN, Extension, History Logs and etc. 
<h4>World Wide Web</h4>
 - also known as the web 
Refers to all the public websites or pages that users can access on their local computers and other devices through the internet. These pages and documents are interconnected by means of hyperlinks that users click on for information. This information can be in different formats, including text, images, audio and video. 
 
<h4>How does the World Wide Web work? </h4>
Paving the way for an internet revolution that has transformed the world in only three decades, the World Wide Web consists of multiple components that enable users to access various resources, documents and web pages on the internet. Thus, the WWW is like a vast electronic book whose pages are stored or hosted on different servers worldwide. 

<h4>Hypertext </h4>
is a method for instant information cross-referencing that supports communications on the web. Hypertext makes it easy to link content on one web page to content on another web page or site. Hypertext and HTTP enable people to access the millions of websites active on the WWW. 

<h4><b>3.2: Non-Ethical Business Research</b></h4>
</center>
<p>Engaging in non-ethical research can have serious consequences, both for individuals involved and society as a whole. 
Some of the potential consequences include:<p>
<h4><b>Harm to Participants:</b></h4>Participants in non-ethical research may be subjected to physical, psychological, or emotional harm without their informed consent. This can lead to long-lasting negative effects on their well-being.
<h4><b>Erosion of Trust:</b></h4>( belief that they are honest and sincere and will not deliberately do anything to harm you.)Unethical research practices can erode trust between researchers and the public. This can have a lasting impact on the credibility of the scientific community and may make it difficult to recruit participants for future studies.
<h4><b>Damage to Reputation:</b></h4>Researchers and institutions involved in non-ethical research may suffer damage to their reputations. This can impact their ability to secure funding, collaborate with other researchers, and publish in reputable journals.
<h4><b>Legal Consequences:</b></h4>Unethical research practices may result in legal consequences,including lawsuits and fines. Violations of research ethics can lead to legal action both at the institutional and individual levels.
<h4><b>Waste of Resources:</b></h4>Non-ethical research may result in wasted resources, as studies conducted without proper ethical oversight may be deemed invalid or unusable. This can represent a significant loss of time, money, and effort.
<h4><b>Stagnation of Knowledge:</b></h4>If unethical research is discovered and discredited, it can hinder the progress of scientific knowledge. This is because false or fraudulent data can mislead other researchers, wasting their time and resources as they try to build upon flawed foundations.
<h4><b>Social and Cultural Impact:</b></h4>Unethical research can  have broader societal   consequences,influencing public  opinion, policy decisions, and cultural norms based on unreliable or biased informatio . This can lead to the adoption of policies that are not grounded in sound evidence.
<h><b>Regulatory Scrutiny:</b></h4>Non-ethical research practices may attract the attention of regulatory bodies, leading to increased scrutiny and oversight of research activities. This can result in more stringent regulations for the entire research community.
<h4><b>Loss of Academic and Professional Standing:</b></h4>Researchers involved in non-ethical practices may face disciplinary actions, including the revocation of academic degrees, loss of professional licenses, and expulsion from academic and professional organizations.
<h4><b>Ethical Dilemmas and Stress:</b></h4>Individuals involved in non-ethical research may face personal and professional ethical dilemmas, leading to stress, guilt, and other negative psychological effects.
<p>It is crucial for researchers and institutions to adhere to ethical guidelines and principles to ensure the integrity of the scientific process and the well-being of individuals involved in research studies.<p>
